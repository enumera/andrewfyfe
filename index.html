  <h1> Thanks for visiting my site.  Here is a bit about me.</h1>

  <article id="blurb">
    <p>I recently graduated from the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course. I really enjoyed the course and not only that I enjoyed meeting the people there and immersing myself in the tech culture.</p>

<p>Prior to this course I was an ISEB qualified, freelance business process and systems analyst and test manager, interchangeably. I managed teams in tight timescales and pressured projects to deliver whatever the business requirement was.</p>

<p>I am currently a freelance web developer; which means I'm in between jobs and working on any opportunity that comes my way, working professionally for friends or future professional contacts, friends or aquantainces !</p>

<p>Please take a look at my links to the left and feel free to call me or email me or download my cv from the last two links.</p>
<p>Regards, Andrew Fyfe</p>

    <h4>Past work experience</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
        For the past 15 years I have worked in the financial services sector in one role or another.  From 2002 I worked in Prudential in Scotland as an actuarial analyst for 4 years whilst I completed my degree in Management science and mathematics at the University of Stirling.  
        </p>
        <p>I then became business analyst with the same company and cut my teeth in this area for two years and gained a Diploma in business systems analysis and a Six sigma green belt on the way.</p>

        <p>Since 2006 onwards I worked as a freelance business analyst and test manager, interchangably for various companies throughout the UK mainly on complex infrastructure projects with an actuarial theme, either reporting or product related, always in a central role within the programme and acting as the bridge between the IT technical, project management and business techincal.</p>
      </div>

  <h4>My General Assembly(GA) Experience</h4>
      <div>
        <p>I decided to take a few months off to take a bit of a leap of faith in GA and literally immersive myself in a coding course.  And as advertised by GA it is 3 months of coding all day every day, including weekends (managed to take Sundays off !).  Nevertheless I loved every minute of it, the culture, the enthusiasm, the tutors and all involved in this relatively new industry in London.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed bringing all we learnt together in the 3 projects.  Each project involved working on a particular app for a week using new languages and frameworks (last project we had 2 weeks) and then presenting it to the rest of the class.</p>
        <p>During the course we also took part in a 24 hour hackathon, which I enjoyed so much I have already been to my first outside the course, with another two planned ! </p>
    </div>

<h4>General Assembly Projects</h4>
<div>
<p> A brief description of my projects with GitHUB links:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/enumera/GA_schedulerv2"> GA class scheduler</a>: This app managed the resources of GA, current students and applications from new students to support the growing GA business.  The app was built using Ruby on Rails with postgres, CSS3 and HTML5 and managed through GitHUB.

<p><a href="https://github.com/enumera/WDI_WIFI_LDN_JN_2014">WiFind</a>: This was a group project which I really enjoyed; I was the group leader.  This app allows users to find, manage and check out local amenities that have free wifi.  The project was built with Ruby on Rails with postgres, google maps, google OAuth, javascript, jquery, CSS3 and HTML5 and managed with GitHUB.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/enumera/resistance">List more with resindex</a> : This was my final project, a group task delegation app with a bespoke index that I devised myself to manage and priortise tasks through time.  The app was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails with prostgres, javascript , jquery and managed through GitHUB.   Google and twitter OAuth were employed with feed of posts from twitter for users that want it.</p>

  <p>Frameworks and languages I learnt on this course: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS3</p>

     <h5>Hackathons!</h5>
    <div>
      <h4>3 Beards with Yahoo!: London: 22nd of September 2014 </h4>
      <p>There were three of us not one week out of finishing the WDI course, with Mike Harris, a tutor at GA heading off to a 24 hour hackathon in Shoreditch.  I created an app which searched and displayed FLICKR for photos of London on art and culture simultaneously it updated a heatmap of the world showing the location of where the contributors came from.</p>
      <p>This app was built with FLICKR api, google maps, javascript, AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3. Here's the result <a href="http://yahoohack.mansci.co.uk">Flickr_London</a></p>
      <h4>Green Hackfest: Utrecht : 10th October 2014 </h4>
       <h4>3 beards and Hasbro Hackathon: London : 25th October 2014 </h4>
